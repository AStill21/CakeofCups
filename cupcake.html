    <p>Here is a little about our cupcake shop.
      Long ago a person wanted to have the greatest bakery known to man and that person's name was Finster. Finster <em>loved</em> all things sweet. So much so his mother <span class="not-saucey">rest her soul</span> wanted him to be the best that he can be so she sold everything to buy a duplex with a bakery benethe the apartment. They, together, built the shop from the ground up and started making uncom at school bakeries and weekend stands in the city. Business was slow at the time because of their comptetors, Kitties and Kandy, a kitten adoption shop that also sells candy for both humans and cats. But thet did not slow down their insperation and drive. Although it took many many many long suguarless winters before they recieved the publicity they were looking for, eventually that kitty candy store ran out of business <span class="secrets"> rats in the candy barrels! Who knew that keeping animals so close to food was a horrible idea?</span>
